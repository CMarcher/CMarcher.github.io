TraceIt was a personal project that evolved as part of a Computer Studies school assessment. I was annoyed that NZQA removed their very helpful progress tracker, whih allowed you to search for existing standards, add them, input your grades and calculate your progress via the several NCEA metrics.

I wasn't happy with the solutions that still existed on either the App Store or Play Store, so I opted to create my own.

This was my first mobile application.

It allows standards to be selected and added to subjects, grades to be chosen for those standards, and then presents your progress visually through several chart types.
