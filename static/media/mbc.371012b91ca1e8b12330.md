From 2020 to 2022, I developed the Manawaru Bible Chapel mobile app for iOS and Android, with an initial release of August 2021, and a summer update released following that. Both the public-facing and administrator apps were made in Xamarin Forms using C#, and actively depend on a serverless back-end (also written in C#) deployed to AWS, making use of Lambda, Cognito and DynamoDB.

This was my first exposure to cloud development, which set me up well creating other cloud-based applications in the future.
